# Elite101-PreWork

Hello, this is my Chatbot for a retail store called "Targots". 
It answers questions such as Store Hours, the Mapping of the Store, 
and the cost and Products that are sold.

## Having trouble using the ChatBot?

The ChatBot would ask questions and recieving a specific word 
or 'yes/no' in order to confirm its next action to help the Customer.

## Beawared of problems like:

- When selecting the option for 'Map,' the robot is going to print out
  a map within the code, if the map came out in a weird way, try 
  adjusting the width of the console tab. This also solves the list of
  products.

- When selecting the option for 'cost of product,' the coding would work
  properly if you ask for Grocery > Clothing > Electronics. If attemping
  to ask for Clothing > Electronics, the code would get confused between
  a certain line. A Noteable solution for the problem is that you are
  required to ask for Grocery first before selecting Clothing and Electronics.
  For example, select Grocery > Clothing or select Grocery > Electronics,
  After the second selection, when the robot ask if 'you want to view
  another cost of a product? (yes/no).' You can select 'no' to continue
  without confusing the code.
